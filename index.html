            <h5>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
                learning from their experiences was easy.</h5>
            <h6>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave
                me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
                developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an
                incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</h6>
